    # Planck's radiation law tells us that the intensity of radiation per unit area and per unit
    # wavelength lambda from a black body at temperature T is:
    # I(lambda) = (2 * pi * h * c^2 * lambda^-5) / ( exp( (hc) / (lambda * k_b * T) ) - 1 )
    # where h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, and k_b is Boltzmann's constant.

    # a) The wavelength lambda at which the emitted radiation is strongest is the solution of the equation
    # 5e ^( (hc) / (lambda * k_b * T) ) + h*c / (lambda * k_b * T) = 0.

    # And turns out that we can solve fox x in this equation, 5e^-x + x - 5 = 0.

    # binary search method, and hence find a value for the displacement constant.
